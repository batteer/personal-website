            Sesh Tutoring started as as ide project amongst a few friends during the winter of 2014. Due to the size of the tutoring market,
            we felt like we could make a play from an on-demand angle (I know, I know! It was 2014 and we caught the on-demand fever).
           </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            I was in charge of much of the interface design and user experience. This was the first major project I undertook, and was an
            invaluable learning experience. I learned how important it is to develop a healthy working relationship with engineers. A lot
            of design work is often lost in the details, and it is imperative that product + design specs are clear and easy to
            understand. I was often not on the same page as the engineering team to start, which created delays in numerous product
            development cycles.
           </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            Because we were a group of college kids who didn't know what the hell we were doing, I also learned how companies should
            not be run. We did not talk to our users. We did not iterate on the product for far, far too long. In retrospect, I realize that it is easy
            (and often wrong) to assume that your personal beliefs are inline with your users. It is imperative to talk to your users
            and recognize what the pain points of the experience are, as opposed to just always rolling with your gut.
            </p>

            Sesh is definitely what got me hooked on product design. To see the process of idea -> wireframe -> mock up -> product occur
            for the first time was enough for me to realize that I wasnted to pursue product design full time.
