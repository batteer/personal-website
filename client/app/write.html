         As a 13 year old I remember being chased by the cops. My friends and I wore some stupid masks. We rang doorbells of neighbors. We ran. The cops were called. We ran some more. And we did it for the thrill of it. For the chase.
       </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        I remember a similar experience as a 16 or 17 year old. Only, exchange the doorbells for beer and shitty loud music. Cops came. We ran. Wow, what a rush, I thought.
        </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
          We were tempting fate. We didn’t want to get caught, but we didn’t necessarily mind if we had to run. It was all part of it. The cat-and-mouse, toe-the-line shenanigans that I’ve always thought was a (cue the music and fireworks) “AMERICAN EXPERIENCE” that everybody was entitled to.
         </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        In both cases, I was able to get away. But some friends were not. People were cited. Tears were shed. Parents arrived at the scene wearing faces of disappointment to whisk their children away home with threats of grounding and warnings that  *stern face*  “College admissions are going to be so disappointed in you”. Hell, some parents even cried because they were so disappointed
        </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
          The fear that drove us to run wasn’t born out of fear for our lives. It was the fear of getting yelled at. Of getting cited. Of stern looks. Of maybe, possibly fucking up our chances of getting into that one school that Forbes just listed in it’s Top 25 Universities list.

          It makes me physically ill to contrast my sense of privilege and expectations with what millions of black Americans and minorities across the States have to deal with on a daily basis. Philando Castile wasn’t doing anything illegal. He wasn’t seeking the thrill of being chased by the cops like I voluntarily did so many times in middle and high school. He was tip-toeing no law. The fucking light in his car was out. And. He. Got. Shot. Four. Fucking. Times. In front of his girlfriend and her four year old daughter to top it off. And just like that, another black man was made into a hashtag. Only to be remembered again when more bullets are buried, and another hashtag arises from the smoke and puddles of drying blood to join the others who have been so senselessly cut down.
          </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
          I’m disturbed by what Making America Great Again means to so many people. I’m saddened that people who look like me and talk like me, and people who I consider friends, believe in these motives. I’m embarrassed by the rhetoric that is being spun around minorities in America by whites. The Muslim community. The queer community. The hispanic community. The black community. But more than anything, I’m ashamed by my silence.
           </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
          And listen, this isn’t about shaming one opinion vs another. It’s not about drawing a line in the sand. People are entitled to their beliefs and I’m not in the business of shaming. It’s counter-productive and only further entrenches the climate of fear and distrust that’s led to this violent week. BUT. But. Minorities in America cannot be in this fight alone. They’ve been doing that for far too long, and we’re still stuck in the same violent cycle of hatred, fear, and now, tragically, vengeance.

        If you’re privileged and white like me, I’d suggest reading this quote. Do with it what you will, but it has helped guide me towards some type of clarity and guidance.<br>“By visibly hovering near us, they are “proving” that they are “with us.” But the hard truth is this isn’t helping to solve America’s racist problem. The Negroes aren’t the racists. Where the really sincere white people have got to do their “proving” of themselves is not among the black victims, but out on the battle lines of where America’s racism really is — and that’s in their own home communities; America’s racism is among their own fellow whites. That’s where sincere whites who really mean to accomplish something have got to work.
